# GAA-NMF
The feature representation of sequence based on non-negative matrix factorization and its application in protein thermostability prediction
# Document introduction
1.dataset: The Charoenkan.fasta file is used for training the GAA-NMF model, while the Lin.fasta file is divided into a training set and a test set to validate the performance of amino acid grouping.
2.GAA-NMF.py: The GAA-NMF model
3.readfasta: Read the fasta file.
5.Gm-AAC: m groups-amino acid composition.
5.Gm-DPC: m groups-dipeptide composition.
6.Gm-TPC: m groups-tripetide composition.
